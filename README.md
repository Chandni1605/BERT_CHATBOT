# BERT_CHATBOT

#### 🧠 BERT Chatbot using Streamlit

This project showcases a conversational AI chatbot built using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The chatbot leverages Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface and integrates BERT-based models for natural language understanding. The project aims to deliver an intelligent conversational experience by using semantic similarity scoring powered by cosine similarity to generate accurate responses based on user input.

#### 🚀 Project Overview
The BERT Chatbot project is a simple yet powerful implementation of a context-aware chatbot. It combines deep learning with a web-based interface using the following key technologies:

BERT Tokenizer and Model from the transformers library to encode input text.
Cosine Similarity to compare user input with pre-defined responses and select the most relevant one.
Streamlit for building an interactive and intuitive web app interface.
Torch (PyTorch) for tensor operations and working with BERT models.

#### ⚙️ Key Features
✅ Interactive User Interface using Streamlit
✅ Contextual Understanding with BERT-based encoding
✅ Semantic Matching through Cosine Similarity
✅ Pre-defined Responses for efficient chatbot replies
✅ Secure Input Handling with Base64 Encoding
